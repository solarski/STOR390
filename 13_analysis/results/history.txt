Major Rule changes

Fouls Count as Strikes - 1903
	Fouls didn’t count as strikes prior to 1903! Difficult to strike out, incentive to keep swinging - someone hit .426
	This lead to the dead ball era

“Deaball era” (1900-1917) - advantage to pitchers
	Only 3-4 baseballs used per game (compared to ~70 today), huge pitcher advantage
	Pitchers were allowed to dirty ball (encouraged) which lead to unpredictable movement;  baseballs weren’t strung as tightly; these factors led to ball not traveling as far (14 hr was about the max)
	Batters focused on singles and double to bat in runs - also a lot more triples?
		Spitball banned after person hit by pitch died (1920 season)
	Some pitchers had 40 win seasons lowest ERA (earned run average) was around 1.51

Spitball banned in 1920
	1919 ERA leader: 1.49 1921 ERA leader: 2.48
	1919 Babe ruth: 29 HR -> 1921 Babe Ruth -> 59!, more home runs -> more revenue?
	Prior to deadball: 17 pitchers had 30 wins, after 3 had 30 wins, today it’s very hard to get 20 

Mound height lowered from 15 to 10 inches in 1969
	Pitchers appeared less intimidating, a higher mound made the ball come out of hand harder & faster - ball now reached plate lower - hitters get more reaction time

Designated Hitter
	1972, only in American League, a designated hitter (Doesn’t field) was allowed to take hitter spot of pitcher
	1972 AL hits: 14,751 1973 AL hits: 17,193

Change in way baseball was made
	Horsehide -> cowhide 1972 - no real difference?

Baseball integrated 1947 - Jackie Robinson - record # of fans
	1947 - .9% African American -> 1975 18.5%

Steroids (~1990-2003)
	Estimated to begin in late 1980s, significant increase in power hitters
	Prior to 1996 5 or less players broke 40 HRs in a year, 1996 17 did!
	Testing began in 2002, amount >40 hr dropped below 10 every year

Stolen bases
	Super popular in early 20th century b/c of low scoring nature of game (focus on bunts, hit and runs, etc).. Teams averaged over 10 SB per home run
	1920s home runs overtook them
	1950s steals took a low point w/abundance of big time power hitters
	60s became popular again b/c influence of Luis Aparacio who would win stolen bases for 9 straight years, peaked in 1970s

Batting %age
	Relatively steady over time not too much exciting!
